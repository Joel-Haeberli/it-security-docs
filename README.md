## Contribution guidelines

- only gpg signed commits are allowed
- please install `pre-commit` to enforce some checks before commiting
- create commit messages according to [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)

### Pre-commit

We use pre-commit to enforce some checks before commiting. Pre-commit must be installed on the client:

* [https://pre-commit.com/](https://pre-commit.com/)

The hook must still be installed in the repository in each case:

```bash 
pre-commit install
```
