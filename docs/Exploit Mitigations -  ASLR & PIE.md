## Claim

ASLR & PIE are mitigations which make it impossible to **locate** data.

## General - ASLR

**A**ddress **S**pace **L**ayout **R**andomization (ASLR) **randomizes the memory layout** of each execution of a program. This leads to different perspectives for the same process, each time it is started. Hardcoding addresses is therefore not feasible for attackers. ASLR is a runtime specific exploit mitigation.
## General - PIE

**P**osition **I**ndependent **E**xecutable (PIE) besides the randomization of the memory layout also randomizes the location of included executables. PIE is a compile time exploit mitigation strategy.
