## Claim

**ASCII Armor** makes it **impossible** to ***insert*** certain data.

## General

ASCII Armor is a exploit mitigation strategy at **runtime**. It makes sure to map addresses of libraries to memory addresses with leading null byte(s). Like this it becomes hard to abuse C's `strcpy` and similar behaving functions, because the null byte indicates this functions the termination of strings.

ASCII Armor fights trivial attacks overwriting a buffer using functions which terminate when a specified termination character is read.
