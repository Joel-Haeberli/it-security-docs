## Claim

DEP prevents the **execution** of uploaded code

## General

**D**ata **E**xecution **P**revention (DEP) makes sure that certain memory regions are no longer executable by adding a permission model to them. Therefore each memory region has flags for reading (R), writing (W) and executing (X) data inside the specific region. The program will only run code, when it is located inside a memory region having the `X`-flag enabled. In practice the `code` segment having the `X`-flag enabled, will have the `W`-flag not set. Like this an attacker cannot write to the memory region where the executable code lies. Therefore they won't be able to inject shellcode. Generally it is a bad idea to have memory regions which have set the `X`- and `W`-flag for this reason.
