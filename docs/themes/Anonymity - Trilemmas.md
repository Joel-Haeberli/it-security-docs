## Examples for famous trilemmas

**CAP Theorem**

This theorem is a concept in distributed data store systems which states that it is impossible for a distributed data store to simultaneously provide more than two out of the following three guarantees: Consistency (all nodes see the same data at the same time), Availability (every request receives a response about whether it was successful or failed), and Partition Tolerance (the system continues to operate despite arbitrary partitioning due to network failures).

**Blockchain Trilemma**

This is a concept in blockchain technology that posits it's impossible to fully achieve all three of the following features at once: Security (the network can resist attacks), Scalability (the network can process a high number of transactions), and Decentralization (all peers in the network are equal, and there are no trusted third parties).

**Ryge's Trilemma**

This is a concept in information security where three desirable attributes - Anonymity, Free Speech, and Accountability - are in conflict. The idea is that you can have any two, but not all three together. If you have anonymity and free speech, you lose accountability. If you have free speech and accountability, you lose anonymity. And if you have anonymity and accountability, you lose free speech.

**Zooko's Triangle**

This is a concept in naming systems which argues that names can't be all three of the following: Secure (names honestly represent the identity of the named entity), Decentralized (no central authority is needed to control name allocation), and Human-meaningful (names are meaningful and memorable to humans). More recent developments in technology, such as blockchain systems, are challenging the notion of Zooko's Triangle, with claims that all three properties can be satisfied to some extent.
