## CAP Theorem

> No distributed system can be consistent, available and partition tolerant at the same time.

- ﻿﻿**Consistency**: A read sees the changes made by all previous writes
- ﻿﻿**Availability**: Reads and writes always succeed
- ﻿﻿**Partition tolerance**: The system operates even when network connectivity between components is broken

## Blockchain Trilemma

This is a concept in blockchain technology that posits it's impossible to fully achieve all three of the following features at once: 

- **Security**: the network can resist attacks
- **Scalability**: the network can process a high number of transactions
- **Decentralization**: all peers in the network are equal, and there are no trusted third parties

## Ryge's Trilemma

Ryge's Triangle postulates three key management goals for a system associating cryptographic keys with addresses or names:

- ﻿﻿**Non-interactive**: the system should require no user interface
- ﻿﻿**Flexible**: addresses / names can be re-used by other participants
- ﻿﻿**Secure**: the system is secure against active attackers  

Ryge's triangle says that one can only have two of the three.

## Zooko's Triangle

This is a trilemma concept in **naming systems** which argues that names can't be all three of the following: 

- **Secure**: names honestly represent the identity of the named entity.
- **Decentralized/ Global**: no central authority is needed to control name allocation
- **Human-meaningful/ Memorable**: names are meaningful and memorable to humans.
