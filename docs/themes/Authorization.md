## Authorization

- specifying access rights / privileges to resources
- related to access control / policies
- bundling authentication and authorization is a **bad idea**
	- e.g. certificate contains the specific roles of the user

**Authentication assurance / Level of Assurance (LoA)**: amount of certainty with which a claim to an identity can be trusted to be accurate

**Identity assurance**: level of identity assurance at initial verification process to ensure that the user is actually this person (email, address, ID, passport, ...)
