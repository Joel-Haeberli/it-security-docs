## $2^{256}$

$2^{256}$ is an unfathomably large number. It's $\sim 10^{77}$ in decimal. The (observable) universe is estimated to contain $10^{80}$ atoms.

It is many orders of magnitude larger than the estimated number of grains of sand on Earth, which is around $5.23 \times 10^{23}$.

## $2^{128}$

The number of seconds that have elapsed since the Big Bang is believed to be around $10^{17}$. Even if every second of the universe's existence had been used to generate a new, unique value, we would still be far from exhausting $2^{128}$ possibilities.

$2^{128}$ = $\sim 3.4 \times 10^{38}$

## How much entropy

**Dice**

$\frac{1}{6} \cdot \log_{2} 6 \cdot 6 = 2.58$ bit

**Latte Macchiato**

$2^{83}$ = $\sim 8.36 \times 10^{24}$

Ca. 16 times all the sand grains on planet earth are in one cup^^ (in regards to bits of entropy)

**Card deck shuffle**

$36! = 2^{138}$
