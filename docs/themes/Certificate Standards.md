- X.509 Certificates (for public keys)
- [[Attribute Certificates|Attribute Certificates]] (bind set of descriptive data items to a subject name)
- PGP Certificates (Pretty Good Privacy. Web of Trust)
- CV Certificates (Card Verifiable Certificates)

X.509 certificates are not compatible to OpenPGP or CVC.

## X.509

The [[X.509 Certificates]] Authentication Framework designed by CCITT/[[003 Organisations#^1776b5|ITU]] for the purpose of securing the X.500 Directory included a certificate specification where the format and data type remain important until today.

Used in:

* The official IETF PKI standard: PKIX (Public Key Infrastructure for X.509)
* The (older) industrial standard: PKCS (Public Key Cryptography Standards)

X.509 is an ITU standard â€” but also:

- TLS servers (and sometimes clients) are identified by public key
- Public keys are certified by certificate authorities  
- X.509 certificates are the format used for certificates  
- Any certificate authority can certify keys for any domain (Not in DNSsec)

Also used by [[MIME#S/MIME|S/MIME]]

## PKCS

* Published by RSA
* Goal was to promote public-key techniques
* Not open standards --> Industrial standards
	* Most were moved into PKIX

## X.500

X.500 entries are based on a Distinguished Name (DN), which is part of a global unique namespace. (Hint: LDAP)

Hierarchy: 

1. Roots
2. Countries
3. Organisations
4. Organisational units
5. People

> Root --> USA --> Google --> Staff --> John Doe

```
CN = Thawte Personal Freemail Issuing CA,
O = Thawte Consulting (Pty) Ltd, C = ZA
```

## ASN.1 and DER

**Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1):**

* Defined by the ITU-T  
* Specifies type and structure of data:
	* Type of value (integer, boolean, character string, etc.) 
	* Structure (containment, order, options)
* Does not specify encoding (representation)

**Distinguished Encoding Rules (DER):**

Provides the advantage to have a unique way of encoding each ASN.1 value.

## Object Identifiers (OIDs)

* An Object Identifier (OID) is an identifier used to name an object in a hierarchically-assigned namespace.
* In the security domain, OIDs serve to name almost every object type in X.509 certificates, such as components of Distinguished Names, Algorithms, etc.

## Self-signed certificates

- Signer is self  
- Allowed by TLS  
- Used to sign CA tree roots
