[[Scripts#Bitcoin Script|Bitcoin Script]] allows to define conditionals. These conditionals are built like:

```
IF
	run on condition true
ELSE
	run on condition false
ENDIF
```

The IF operator reads a condition from the stack and enters the branch according the evaluation of the condition. A condition resulting in non-zero values means true.

Conditionals are useful in case of [escrow situations](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/escrowagreement.asp).
