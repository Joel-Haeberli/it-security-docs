## Issues with Credit Cards

- When you pay by CC, the information includes your name  
- When you pay in person with CC, your location is also known 
- You often have no alternative payment methods available  
- You hardly ever can use someone elseâ€™s CC  
- Anonymous prepaid cards are difficult to get and expensive  
- Payment information is typically stored for at least 6 years

### 3D secure

A nightmare. (Complicated, no privacy, customer is liable, exclusion of vendors)

## Issues with Banks

- Global tech companies push oligopolies 
- Privacy and federated finance are at risk
- Economic sovereignty is in danger

## Examples

- Bank of International Settlements (CBDC - Central Bank Digital Currency without privacy)
- Emergency Act Canada (Freeze bank accounts)
