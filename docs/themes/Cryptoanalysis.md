# Cryptoanalysis

The art or process of deciphering coded messages without being told the key.

- Brute Force Attack
- Indistinguishability (IND)
- Non-Malleability (NM) - The One Time Pad is vulnerable to this
- Ciphertext only Attack (CoA)
- Known Plaintext Attack (KPA)
- Chosen Ciphertext Attack (CCA)
- Chosen Plaintext Attack (CPA)

If the cipher holds against this it is IND-CPA secure.
