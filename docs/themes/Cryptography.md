Dictionary definition: the art of writing or solving codes.

'Crypto' (Hidden) 'Graphia' (Writing)

[[Computer Security Dictionary#^51231c|Cryptography]] is but a tool to maintain security. See also [[Computer Security Dictionary#^8ae895|Kerckhoffs’ principle]]

Through cryptography we can maintain **PAIN**:

- **P**rivacy
- **A**uthenticity
- **I**ntegrity
- **N**on-repudiation

With cryptography we can secure an already secure process in an insecure environment. It's not possible to secure an insecure process.
