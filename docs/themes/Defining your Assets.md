- Private keys (at least lock with password)
- Sensitive data as specified in regulatory frameworks:
	- General Protection Regulation: GDPR (EU) 
	- Federal Act on Data Protection: FADP (CH)
		- Any personal data (data that can be linked to a person), must be protected
		- Goal of keeping this data must be approved
		- Organisation holding such data must declare the data and used technics to store them to the data comminssioner.
