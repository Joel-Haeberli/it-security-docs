## Double Spending Attack
The Double Spending Attack is the act of writing the same transaction with different recipients, so that the same coin is spent twice -> therefore double spending. 

The Problem is approximately solved by the [[From BankCoin to IncentiveCoin#BlockchainCoin|BlockchainCoin]] under following **assumptions**:

1. Network will always find consensus eventually (see [[Eventual Consistency]])
2. The Recipients of a payment wait long enough before delivering their assets (waiting in this context means that a transaction has enough confirmations, so that it can be seen as final [[Transaction Confirmation]])
3. Nobody controls close to half of the network (which is hard according to [[From BankCoin to IncentiveCoin#IncentiveCoin|IncentiveCoin]])
