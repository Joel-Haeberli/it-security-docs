## Internet Design Goals, David Clark, 1998

1. **Internet communication must continue despite loss of networks or gateways.**
2. The Internet must support multiple types of communications service.
3. The Internet architecture must accommodate a variety of networks.
4. The Internet architecture must permit *distributed management* of its resources.
5. The Internet architecture must be cost effective.
6. The Internet architecture must permit host attachment with a low level of effort.
7. **The resources used in the internet architecture must be accountable.**

## Collateral Damage

- HACIENDA by JTRIG: port scans entire countries using nmap (randomly scans every ip identified in that country)
- ORB: CSECs Operational Relay Box, 2-3 times/year 1 day focused effort to acquire as many new ORBs as possible in as many non 5-Eyes countries as possible
- RAMPART-A by NSA: global mass surveillance, gain access to high-capacity international fiber-optic cabels, collect data on the host countries citizens
- TREASUREMAP by NSA: capability for building a near real-time, interactive map of the global internet

- You should care!
- No privacy $\rightarrow$ no free press $\rightarrow$ No liberal democracy
- Administrators have power, power attracts mexican drug cartels $\rightarrow$  **Goal**: the cartel has nothing to gain from abduction your family and will not bother with it. The public system design must be clear that you are not able to assist, also under these circumstances.

## GNUnet Design Goals

1. GNUnet must be implemented as free software.
2. **The GNUnet must only disclose the minimal amount of information necessary.**
3. **The GNUnet must be decentralised and survive Byzantine failures in any position in the network.**
4. **The GNUnet must make it explicit to the user which entities must be trustworthy when establishing secured communications.**
5. **The GNUnet must use compartmentalization to protect sensitive information.**
6. The GNUnet must be open and permit new peers to join.
7. **The GNUnet must be self-organizing and not depend on administrators.**
8. The GNUnet must support a diverse range of applications and devices.
9. The GNUnet architecture must be cost effective.
10. **The GNUnet must provide incentives for peers to contribute more resources than they consume.**
