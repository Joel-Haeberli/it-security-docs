Three fundamental concepts in abstract algebra, each with its own set of properties and characteristics. They are hierarchical, in that:

* every field is a ring, 
* every ring is a group (under addition)

The reverse is not necessarily true. 

Fields have the most structure and groups the least.

## Group

See [[Group Theory]]

A group is a set, $G$, together with an operation $\circ$ (often interpreted as addition or multiplication) that combines any two elements $a, b \in G$ to form another element denoted $a \circ b \in G$. A group must satisfy four properties:

- **Closure**: For all $a, b$ in $G$, the result of the operation, $a \circ b$, is also in $G$
- **Associativity**: For all $a, b$ and $c$ in $G$, $(a \circ b) \circ c$ equals $a \circ (b \circ c)$
- **Identity**: There exists an element $e$ in $G$ such that for every element $a$ in $G$, the equations $e \circ a$ and $a \circ e$ return $a$
- **Invertibility**: For each element $a$ in $G$, there exists an element $b$ in $G$ such that $a \circ b = b \circ a = e$, where $e$ is the identity element

## Ring

A ring is a set equipped with two binary operations, usually referred to as addition and multiplication, that generalizes the arithmetic operations on integers. It's an additive group, but with extra structure. A ring satisfies the properties of a group under addition and has two additional properties related to the second operation (multiplication):

- **Multiplicative associativity**: For all $a$, $b$ and $c$ in the ring, $(a \times b) \times c$ equals $a \times (b \times c)$
- **Distributivity**: For all $a$, $b$, and $c$ in the ring, $a \times (b+c) = a \times b + a \times c$ and $(b+c) \times a = b \times a + c \times a$

## Field

See [[Elliptic Curves]]

A field is a ring where both operations are commutative (the order in which the operations are performed does not change the result), there's a multiplicative identity (other than the additive identity), and every non-zero element has a multiplicative inverse. It satisfies all the properties of a ring, but with additional restrictions:

- **Multiplicative Identity**: There is an element, usually denoted as $1$ (and different from the additive identity $0$), such that for every element $a$ in the field, $1 \times a = a \times 1 = a$
- **Multiplicative Inverse**: For each non-zero element $a$ in the field, there exists an element $b$ in the field such that $a \times b = b \times a = 1$, where $1$ is the multiplicative identity
- **Commutativity**: For all $a$ and $b$ in the field, $a \times b = b \times a$ (for multiplication), and $a+b = b+a$ (for addition)
