**Typical approach** to manage information security:

- Analyze risks against information assets
- **Mitigate these risks** by countermeasures (i.e. security controls)
- Reactive plans to minimize damage if a risks turns into a problem

**Goals of the Information security management (ISM)**:

- Align information security with business security
- Ensure that information security is effectively managed $\rightarrow$ In all service (management) activities

**Security Framework**

A ISM process/framework generally consists of:

- Information Security Policy
- Information Security Management System
- Security strategy
- Security organizational structure
- Set of security controls
- Risk management
- Process monitoring
- Communication strategy/plan
- Training

## Risk Managements

Analyzing risks against information assets is the basis of an information security risk management (One of the standards = ISO/IEC 27005 Information Security Risk Management)

A simple approach can be the "traffic light" matrix:

![[Risk-traffic-light.png]]

Each risk can be categorized using this matrix. Measures must be taken to at least mitigate the red risks.

**Handling Risks**

There exist four options to manage risks:

- Risk avoidance
	- Change of the situation to avoid the risk
	- Done during development of new services/processes
	- Very cost intensive
- Risk modification
	- Minimize the probability of occurrence and/or level of damage
- Sharing the responsibility
	- Close insurance policy or outsource service
- Risk acceptance
	- Accept and live with the risk and accept the potential damage

## Information Security Policy

Should cover all areas of security and should include (according to ITILv3):

- Overall Information Security policy
- IT assets policy
- Access control policy
- Password control policy
- E-mail (use) policy
- Internet (use) policy
- Anti-virus policy
- Information classification policy
- Document classification policy
- Remote access policy
- Supplier access policy (to IT services, information and components)
- Asset disposal policy

## Information Security Management System

The Information Security Management System (ISMS) is the basis for the development of the information security program. It supports the business objectives.

Involves **the 4 Ps**:

- People
- Process
- Products and technology
- Partners and suppliers

ISMS lifecycle according to ITIL:

![[ISMS-ITIL.png]]

**Seven steps to implement an ISMS**:

- Secure executive support and set the objectives
- Define the scope of the system
- Evaluate assets and analyze the risk
- Define the Information Security Management System
- Train and build competencies for the Roles
- System maintenance and monitoring
- Certification audit

**Certification of the ISMS**

- An ISMS can archive an certification
- Most common in Switzerland is the certification against ISO/IEC 27001
	- ISO/IEC 27001 is the certification standard and belongs to the ISO/IEC 27000-series, which is a series of information security standards. Only 27001 can be certified
	- Contains best practice recommendations to maintain an ISMS
	- The series consists of many standards over 30 standards are bundled under its name

## Security Controls

Security professionals (us) have to...

- understand the requirements of business (for information asset protection)
- understand the risk for a particular information asset
- devise and understand the countermeasures for risks

To protect information assets we have to implement **security controls**

Security control families according to NIST:

Example Access Control Family (AC):

![[NIST-Access-Control-Controls.png]]

**NSA recommendations:**

3 controls have a special value for immediate implementation for organizations that have not yet implemented complete defenses:

- Malware Defenses
- Data Recovery Capability
- Security Skills Assessment and Appropriate Training to fill gaps

### Center of Internet Security CIS

CIS is a non-profit to safeguard private and public organizations against cyber threats.

CIS provides:

- Cybersecurity Best Practices
- Cybersecurity Tools
- Cybersecurity Threats
- Controls to protect organizations from known cyber-attack vectors

The five critical tenets of an effective cyber defense system:

- Offense informs defense
- Prioritization
- Measurements and Metrics
- Continuous diagnostics and mitigation
- Automation

## Security Incident Management

### Terms and definitions (ISO/IEC)

- Incident response team (IRT)
	- Team that handles incidents
- Information security event
	- A possible breach of information security or failure of controls
- Information security incident
	- Identified information security events that can harm an assets or compromise operations
- Information security incident management
	- Consistent and effective approach in handling information security incidents
- Incident handling
	- Detecting, reporting, assessing, responding, dealing with and learning from information security incidents
- Incident response
	- Actions taken to mitigate or resolve an information security incident.

### Overview

![[Overview-security-incident-management.png]]

### Objectives

- Avoid or contain the impact of information security incidents (Minimize damage)
- Information security events are detected and dealt with
- Information security incidents are assessed and responded
- The effects of information security incidents are minimized
- An escalation process to crisis management and business continuity management is established
- Information security vulnerabilities are assessed and dealt with
- Lessons are learnt

### Benefits

- Improving overall information security
- reducing business impacts
- Streangthening focus on information security incident prevention
- Improving priorization
- Supporting evidence collection/investigation
- Improving updates to information security risk assessment
- providing information security awareness
- Providing input to the information security policy

### Phases

The phases are like a cycle.

- Plan and prepare
	- Information security incident management policy
	- Information security policies (related to risk management)
		- On corporate, system, service and network levels
	- Information security incident management plan
	- Incident response team IRT establishment
	- Awareness briefings and training
- Detect and report
	- Collecting awareness information (Local environment, external data sources and news feeds)
	- Monitoring
	- Detection and alerting of anomalous, suspicious or malicious activities
	- Collection of information security event reports
- Assess and decide
- Respond
	- Determine if information security incidents are under control by investigation
	- Containment and eradication of Information security incidents
	- Recovery from incidents
	- Resolution and closure
	- Further investigation if required
- Learn lessons
	- Identification of lessons learnt and improvements to information security (risk assessment/management plan)

### Examples Information security incidents

- Attacks
	- DoS or DDos
	- Unauthorized access
	- Malware
	- Abuse
		- Violation of information system security policies
- Information gathering
	- Identifying of potential targets
	- understanding services running on targets
- Confidentiality incidents
	- Information leaks have immediate effects on an organization
	- Makes information available for unauthorized entities
- Integrity Incidents
	- Should be detected and corrected before publishing
- Availability incidents
	- Unavailability of information could create effects on e.g SLAs
- Access Control incident
	- Unauthorized access = system compromize
	- Can lead to theft of resources or information breaches
- Vulnerabilities
	- Unpatched servers or software
	- May allow successful exploitation
- Technical failures
	- Can lead to vulnerabilities
- Theft or loss of equipment
	- Those containing information should be considered as availability and or confidentiality incidents
