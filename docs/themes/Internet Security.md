**Overview**

* Is a branch of information security
* Establishes rules and measures
* The Internet is an insecure place (intrusion, fraud service obstruction/interruption)

**Incidents**

The Internet Worm / Morris Worm was one of the first computer worms, infecting 10% of all computers connected to the internet. The Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT) was formed as a response and Security started to matter after this incident.

Became even more important in the 90s with the commercialisation of the internet. 

**RFCs**

Internet Security Handbooks were published. RFCs must contain a Security considerations section since a long time.
