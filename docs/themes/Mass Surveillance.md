**Five eyes**

The Five Eyes (FVEY) is an intelligence alliance comprising Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States.

**Building Blocks**

- Travel Patterns
- Behaviour Analytics

A lot of math is used to identify targets. Who is innocent and who is not. The US kills based on metadata but they only have percentages if somebody is a valid target for them. Even if they are 99.82% certain the collateral damage is enormous. (343,800 innocent citizens for Pakistan for example) 

**Conclusion**

* Computers have no sense of ethics.  
* Physical reality (including code) beats human law.
	* â‡’ We need to be careful about which technology we adopt.
