*Public Key Cryptography Standards (PKCS)* is a group of public key cryptography standards published by RSA Security LC.

*Some Important Standards (not complete):*

- **PKCS #1**: RSA Cryptography Standard ([[RSA]])
- **PKCS #3**: Diffie-Hellman Key Agreement Standard ([[Diffie-Hellman|DH]])
- **PKCS #5**: Password-based Encryption Standard ([[Password Based Key Derivation Function (PBKDF)#PBKDF1 & PBKDF2|PBKDF2]])
- **PKCS #7**: Cryptographic Message Syntax Standard (sign/ encrypt messages under a [[Public Key Infrastructure|PKI]], [[X.509 Certificates|X509]]) 
- **PKCS #10**: Certification Request Standard ([[Public Key Infrastructure|PKI]])
- **PKCS #11**: Defines an API, commonly known as Cryptoki, for devices that hold cryptographic information and perform cryptographic functions. PKCS\#11 is used by hardware security modules (HSMs), smart cards, and other secure cryptographic token devices to interface with cryptographic functions in a device-agnostic way.
- **PKCS #12**: Specifies a portable format for storing or transporting a userâ€™s private keys, certificates, and miscellaneous secrets. It is commonly used to bundle a private key with its X.509 certificate or to bundle all the members of a chain of trust.
- **PKCS #13**: Elliptic-curve cryptography Standard ([[Elliptic Curves]])
- **PKCS #14**: Pseudo-random Number Generation ([[Pseudorandom Number Generator (PRNG)|PRNG]])
