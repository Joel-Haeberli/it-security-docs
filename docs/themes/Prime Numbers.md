- A prime number is a positive integer $p \gt 1$ that has no positive divisors other than 1 and $p$
- Examples: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19
- Greatest known prime: $2^{82589933} -1$ (found in 2019)
- Euclid's theorem (300 BC) says that there are an infinite number of prime numbers.

**Prime counting function:** $\pi(n)$ is the number of primes smaller or equal to $n$. For example $\pi(13)=6$

**Prime number theorem:** $\pi(n) \approx \frac{n}{\ln n}$

In other words, when $n$ is large, then the probability that $n$ is prime is approximately: $\frac{1}{\ln n} = \frac{\log e}{\log n}= \frac{1.44}{\log n}\approx \frac{1}{\log n}$
