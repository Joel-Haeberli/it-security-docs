- Public Key: $A$ can be published on a website or directory, or sent over an insecure channel.
- Private Key: $a$ must be kept secret.

The paper by Diffie and Hellman invented the principle of public key encryption based on public/private keys. But they didn't describe an actual scheme.

The first scheme was published by R. Rives, A. Shamir and L. Adleman ([[RSA]]) in 1977.

## The scheme

The public-key encryption scheme consists of a message space $M$ and three randomised polynomial-time algorithms.

- Key generation: ($pk$, $sk$) $\leftarrow keyGen()$ 
- Encryption: $c \leftarrow enc_{pk}(m)$
- Decryption: $m := dec_{sk}(c)$

such that $dec_{sk}(enc_{pk}(m)) = m$ holds for all messages $m \in M$, and all key-pairs

- $K$ called key space is the set of all pairs generated by $keyGen()$
- $C$ called ciphertext space is the set of all ciphertexts generated by $enc_{pk}(m)$

$$enc : K_{pk} \times M \rightarrow C \qquad dec: K_{sk} \times C \rightarrow M$$

## Private Communication

The most important application of public-key encryption is private communication over an insecure channel.

1. Alice generates a key pair ($pk$, $sk$) and sends $pk$ to Bob (over an authenticated channel)
2. Bob computes the ciphertext $c \leftarrow enc_{pk}(m)$ and sends $c$ over an insecure channel to Alice
3. Alice computes the plaintext $m := dec_{sk}(c)$

- Eve (Eavesdropper) can't learn anything about $m$ (or $sk$)
- If the $pk$ is transmitted without authentication, this approach is vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks (similar to [[Diffie-Hellman]]).

## Hardness Assumptions

**Discrete logarithm assumption (and stronger):**

- [[Diffie-Hellman]] key exchange
- [[ElGamal]] encryption scheme
- [[DSA signature scheme]]
- [[Schnorr Signatures|Schnorr signature scheme]]
- Pedersen commitment scheme

**Integer factorisation assumption (and stronger)**

- [[RSA]] encryption/signature scheme
- Rabin encryption scheme
- Pailler encryption scheme
- Goldwasser-Micali encryption scheme
- Blum-Blum-Shub pseudorandom number generator
