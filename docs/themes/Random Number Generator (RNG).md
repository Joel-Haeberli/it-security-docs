## RNG

A **RNG** is an algorithm or device designed to generate a sequence of numbers that lacks any pattern or predictability. Each number in the sequence is supposed to be statistically independent of the others.

## TRNG

**TRNG** stands for True Random Number Generator. Unlike RNGs, which are often pseudorandom, TRNGs generate random numbers from a physical process, not a set algorithm.

## RNG to PRNG

RNGs produce true random bits relatively slowly from analog sources, in a nondeterministic way, and with no guarantee of high entropy. In contrast, a [[Pseudorandom Number Generator]] (PNRG) produces random-looking bits into a long stream of reliable pseudorandom bits suitable for crypto applications.
