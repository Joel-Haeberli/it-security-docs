## Message Routing

- mails are sent via **Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP)**
- the **mail exchanger record (MX record)** specifies the mail server responsible for a domain name
- the sending MTA queries DNS for the MX records of the recipient's domain name. The **lowest-numbered records are the most preferred**
- **MTA**: Mail Transfer Agent, SMTP server which forwards a mail
- **MUA**: Mail User Agent, pick up mails via POP3 or IMAP
