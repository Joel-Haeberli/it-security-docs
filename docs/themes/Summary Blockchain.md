## Goal

- ability to conduct transactions between two parties who do not know or trust each other
- no third party!

**Properties**

- Blockchain is an accounting system (ledger), not a currency
- **Proof of Work**: as an invitation to tender, get bitcoins for work
	- all 4 years, the profit is halved
- *inflation*: there is an absolut limit of bitcoins, the hard cap, wich is 21 Million Coins (90% has already been scooped)
- *deflation*: no one can help, money supply shrinks (lost wallets, typos)
- a new block per 10 Min
- bitcoin's protection against corruption is the price of electricity
- **Protection against replay attack**: destroy old coins, create two new ones (for each party of the transaction)
- system is closed (change in Dollar, other currencies)
- 30min to accepted transaction
- if you have 50% of the mining-power, you can control the blockchain

## "Improvements"

- **Proof of Stake**: not random, the winner (larger stake) collects fees, increases stake (Oligarchy)
- **Proof of Authority**: only governments can write
- **Smart Contracts**: not only data, also code in blockchain
- **Stablecoin**: Tether
