## Transaction Confirmation

The higher the number of confirmations of a transaction the more likely the transaction will be permanently written to the chain. The number of confirmation consists of two factors:

1. The number blocks containing the transaction
2. The number of blocks after the block containing the transaction

There is a rule of thumb which says that you should wait 6 confirmations until a transaction can be considered final.
